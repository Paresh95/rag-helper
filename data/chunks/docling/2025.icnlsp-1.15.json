Notably, the document chunking process plays a central role in the performance of RAG pipelines. Nevertheless, incoherent document splits and inappropriate chunk sizes hinder retrieval efficiency and contextual accuracy. To address this, we propose Recursive Semantic Chunking (RSC), a dynamic and adaptive chunking framework that ensures semantic coherence. It maintains coherence by recursively splitting large chunks and merging smaller ones. Unlike conventional methods, RSC preserves contextual integrity while optimizing retrieval efficiency. The evaluation across 4 distinct datasets outperformed traditional semantic chunking techniques on evaluation metrics; contextual relevancy, contextual precision, contextual recall, retrieval time, faithfulness and answer relevancy. Results demonstrate that RSC consistently outperforms traditional chunking techniques, achieving higher contextual relevancy and total score while maintaining efficient retrieval times. These findings highlight the potential to optimize RAG systems and to improve the document chunking steps in the systems.", "metadata": {"uuid": "aecf9289-94a4-40ea-bad3-89c3af301255", "file_path": "data/processed/docling/2025.icnlsp-1.15.json", "chunk_index": 0, "section_path": ["The Chunking Paradigm: Recursive Semantic for RAG Optimization"], "section_refs": ["#/texts/0"], "page_no": 1, "tokens": 210}}, {"text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely adopted across various domains in the form of chatbots, AI assistants, and other applications (Siddharth and Luo, 2024; Sahlman et al., 2023).
